# Raspberry-scripts

As a Raspberry enthusiast I have installed and configured many Pi's
so many times that I got tired of having to do the same things over
and over. Thus, I've created some scripts to automate things. May
they be useful to others too.

The usual disclaimer: I am in no way responsible for any kind of
damage that my scripts do to you or your computer. If you are not
comfortable with the risks involved, don't use my stuff. Please
read the LICENSE file for more information on the subject.
